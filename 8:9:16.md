##Intro to Cascading Stylesheets: CSS
####Anatomy of a Style
* Selector(p)  declaration--contains {property: value}
```p {color: red}``` --entire thing is called a rule
 
* Selector Types
	* Type selector
		* ```h1{ color:blue; }```
	* class selector
		* ```.menuItem{ width: 500px; }```

	* ID
		* ```#uniqueBox{ width: 500px; }```	

	* pseudo-selector
		* ```div:hover { color: pink; }```

####Specificity
* Specificity increases
	* Type --> Class --> ID --> Inline
* If specificity is equal, the last declaration win

####Inheritance in CSS
* Decendants inherit properties from parents
* If more than one selector is used to style an element, property styles from **both** selectors will style the element if no conflicts.

####Combinators
* Combine selectors with combinators to target very specific elements
	* decendant selector ``` ```(space) apples to all decendants
		* ```div p { color:blue; }```
	* child selector ```>``` applies to only child of parent element
		* ```div>p { color:blue; }```
	* adjacent sibling selector ```+```
		* ```#class+p { color:blue; }```
	* general sibling selector ```~```
		* ```#class~p { color:blue; }```

####Display
* Block, inline, inline-block, none
	* check [Learn article]() for default desplay value of common elements (ex: default for ```<div>``` is block)
	* [Default Inline]()
	* [Default Block]()

####Box Model
* [margin **border[**padding [Content] padding**]border** margin]
*  Box-Sizing:
	* ```box-sizing: content-box```**default**  when talking about width of box content-box refers to **content only**
	* ```box-sizing: border-box```when we change to border-box  we are talking about **content, padding, and border**

##Intermediate CSS
###Objectives
Describe and Use:

* CSS Reset
* Css Normalizers
* The 4 CSS Positions
* Attribute Selectors
* Psuedo Classes
* CSS to Manipulate Fonts
* CSS to Maniuplate Colors

####CSS Reset & Normalizers
A CSS Reset:

* Removes all styling.
* nothing will have padding, margins, etc (unless you state them)

A CSS Normalizer:

* maintains some styling
* keeps it _consistant_ between browsers

####CSS Positioning

* CSS positions change the flow of the document.
* check for missing notes
* Static: _check Elana's notes/slides_
* Relative:
	* nudge elements in different directions with top, right, bottom, and left values.
	* element still takes up space where it is, but shows up in a new place.
	* Allow a child element to be positioned absolutely wiht reference to it.
* Absolute:
	* takes things out of doc flow and puts them relative to parent (if no parent, reference browser window)
* Fixed:
	* Similar to abosolute but doesn't move if page does, fixed relative to window

####Other attributes:

* Top, Right, Bottom, Left
* Z-Index
	*  controls vertical stacking order of elements
	*  takes only numbered integers
	*  higher the integer, more forward this element is.

####Other Selectors:

* Attribute Selectors
	*  ```<tag attribute=" ">```
	*  ```tag[type^='e']{ property: value; }``` type begining with 'e'
	*  ```tag[type$='d']{ property: value; }``` type ending with 'd'
	*  ```tag[name*='ma']{ property: value; }``` name containing 'ma'
* Psuedo Selectors
	* Link based--```:link```, ```:hover```, ```:visited```, ```:active```
	* Text based--```:firstline```, ```:first letter```, ```:before { content: "..."}```, ```:after { content: "..."}```
* Structural Psuedo Classes	
	* must select an element ```p``` 
	* ```:first-child```, ```:last-child```, ```:nth-child(odd)```, ```:nth-child(even)```, ```:nth-child(3n+4)``` <--selects the 4th child and every 3rd after that
	* ```:nth-of-type(2n+1)``` type is in reference to element

####Font Properties
* ```font-family:```
* ```font-style:```
* ```font-size:```
* ```font-weight:```
* ```font-variant: small-caps;```
* ```font-height:```
* ```font-stretch:```
* ```font-kerning:```

####Color Properties
* Hex Values
* RGB & RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)
	* 0-255, last arg is alpha (transparency)
* HSL & HSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha)
	* 1st number is color hues:
	* 2nd is percentage of saturation
	* 3rd is percentage of brightness
	* the last number is alpha, 0-1

####CSS Inheritance
**Not Inherited**

* Padding
* margins
* positioning
* background
* borders


####_Soft Skills--**Grit**_
* How many pushups could you do in 90 min? gap between what you are capable of and what you think you are capable of is about 20x
* What gets navy seals through their program? **GRIT**
* how to I get from "I can't learn all this this quick, or 'maybe i dont like this'." to GRIT?
	1. catch yourself having those feelings & stop
	2. take a deep breath
	3. just pick a small goal (micro goal)
	4. P.M.A--positive mental attitude "Looking Good, Feeling Good, ought to be in hollywood"
